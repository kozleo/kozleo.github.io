          ['Rendezvous with Rama', 'Arthur C. Clarke', 'Sci Fi', 'Started on 3-27-16 and finished on 3-28-16. One of the best sci-fi books Ive ever read. By FAR Clarkes best work.'],

          ['On Intelligence', 'Jeff Hawkins', 'Non Fiction', 'Finished in late late May, 2017. Not many new ideas, just old ones repackaged--which is not neccesarily a bad thing. Definetly passionate and inspired. Would have been better if he had published actual scientific work, instead of just giving us a general verbal theory. Still enjoyed it, made me argue a lot.'],
          ['Diary of an Oxygen Thief', 'Anonymous', 'Fiction', 'Very funny. Almost like Apathy and Other Small Victories. Finished in early June, 2017.'],
