From Stupid to Smart: A Personal Story

This story is going to be long overall and spiteful throughout. 
It is an autobiography of my life from roughly age 15, when I decided to 'unstupid' myself to age 27, when I am wrapping up my PhD at MIT. It's not like I am particuly distinguished in any way, so you should not read this story if you are hoping to 'make it'. You should read this story if you are young, dumb (e.g medicore grades, test scores, etc) and hoping to stem the tide of your torrential stupidity. Perhaps you even want to reverse the flow and become smart.
