I'm not senior enough to be writing about 'how the brain works'. 

Anyway, here are my thoughts about how the brain works: it has to do with something called 'stability'. 

Before I tell you what that is, let me say that I nicked the title of this post from Mortiz Hardt, who wrote a blog post I very much liked a few  years ago called Stability as a Foundation of Machine Learning. If I can be so bold I'll try to extend some of Mortiz's arguments to the domain of neuroscience.



One type comes from machine learning, and is called *algorithmic stability*. The other type comes from dynamical systems theory, so I'll call it *dynamical stability*. I'll also. 



This point of view says (and I agree, because I'm the one saying it) that something called 'stability' should be a foundational concept in neuroscience. It's inspired by the point of view that stability should be a foundational concept in machine learning. The point is actually extremely clear.
