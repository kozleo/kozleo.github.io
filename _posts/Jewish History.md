I have a longstanding interest in human history. I like learning about everything, from ancient China to modern Greeks. However, like most people, I'm particularly, selfishly, interested in the history of my own ethnic group. For me that group is the Jews. In a way this is fortunate, because Jews have been around for a very long time and therefore a study of the Jewish History will necessarily include a study of general human history. This post is written for fun, and for giving a place to store all my knowledge on the topic. Corrections and comments are always welcome. 

## When Were the First Jews? 

Unsurprisingly, this turns out to be a complicated question.
