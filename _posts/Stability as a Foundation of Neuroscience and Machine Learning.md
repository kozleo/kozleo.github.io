## Anti-Hebbian Plasticity is Perfect Negative Feedback for Linear RNNs
I'm writing my dissertation, and making slides for my defense. Sometimes, this sparks new connections in ones mind. I've found a way to reformulate (and extend) a result from our 2020 paper which I think is more pleasing. We are all familiar with the idea that Hebbian plasticity is fundamentally unstable. Correlated neurons will cause the weights between them to grow, which will cause them to because more correlated, and so on. In this way one can reasonably say that Hebbian plasticity is positive feedback for RNNs. Is it then true that anti-Hebbian plasticity is negative feedback for RNns? The answer is in fact yes, in a technical (and also plain-English) sense.
