# Leo's Guide to *Asimov's Guide to the Bible*

## Introduction

Issac Asimov is most famous as a science fiction writer. But he also wrote extensively (like, ridiculously extensively) on history and literature and science. For years I've been trying to read his massive *Asimov's Guide to the Bible* (AGB). AGB is Asimov's secular attempt at viewing the Bible--both testaments--as a quasihistorical document. He goes through the Bible more or less verse-by-verse and tries to explain the historical context in which the verses were written, as well as connecting many Bible stories to older stories from ancient cities like Babylon. I think AGB is Asimov's attempt at understand the Bible for himself. I want to read AGB and understand as well. 

Here's the problem between me and AGB: *I've never read the Bible.*

Here's the other problem between me and AGB: *I don't know ancient history.*  

I *want* to read the Bible, and I *want* to know ancient history. But every time I've tried to work through ABG I get confused and bogged down by things I'm supposed to know but don't. So I've decided the only way I'm going to understand *Asimov's Guide to the Bible* is if I make a guide to it. Unlike Asimov, I have the internet. I have Markdown files where I can embed things like pictures and videos and hyperlinks. Also unlike Asimov, I have a day job (graduate student) and limited cognitive bandwidth. So my guide--I anticipate--will be 100x smaller that Asimov's, and more to the point. 

Hopefully I get some light in the place where my understand of early human civilization/culture was once dark. So without further ado, I say:

*Let there be light!*

## Genesis 

The times written about in Genesis happened during what is now called ancient human history. This chunk of time is somewhere after Neanderthals disappeared and before Jesus. During this time, something which we call civilization popped up on three separate places on Earth: in Mexico, in China, and in the Fertile Crescent. When you see Fertile Crescent think 'Middle East and Norther Africa'. Places like Iran, Egypt, Syria, Israel. Things happened here which provided inspiration or direct material for the Bible. It's not for nothing that this is also the birthplace of Western civilization.
