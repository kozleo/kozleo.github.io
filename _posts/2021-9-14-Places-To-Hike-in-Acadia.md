   1. Hike to see Bubble Rock, which is a [Glacial Erratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_erratic) (i.e a rock that was carried from one place to another place by a moving glacier). This particular erratic is massive. It was carried probably ~40 miles away from its home by a glacier called the [Laurentide Ice Sheet around ~18,000 years ago](https://digitalmaine.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1513&context=mgs_publications).
