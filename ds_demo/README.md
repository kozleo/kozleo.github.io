# Lorenz System WebGL

This is an interactive animation of a chaotic [Lorenz
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system). Click and drag
to look around the system in 3D. Middle-click and drag to reposition.

Online demo: http://skeeto.github.io/lorenz-webgl/

The demo begins with 13 solutions with very close starting values. You
will see them gradually separate over the first minute or so.
