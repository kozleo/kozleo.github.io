# Dynamical Systems Demo

This is an interactive web demo which allows the user to switch between a variety of dynamical systems. 

It is a fork of [this](https://github.com/skeeto/lorenz-webgl) repository by Christopher Wellons (aka skeeto). Check out his website [here](https://nullprogram.com/) for other cool things.
